As you've seen throughout this section, preprocessing text data is a bit more challenging that working with more traditional data types because there's no clear-cut answer for exactly what sort of preprocessing and cleaning we need to do. Before we can begin cleaning and preprocessing our text data, we need to make some decisions about things such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we remove stop words or not?\n",
    "* Do we stem or lemmatize our text data, or leave the words as is?\n",
    "* Is basic tokenization enough, or do we need to support special edge cases through the use of regex?\n",
    "* Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
    "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",
    "* What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?\n",
    "\n",

    "At first glance, none of these words seem very informative -- for most of the words represented here, it would be tough to guess if a given word is used equally among all five classes, or is disproportionately represented among a single class. This makes sense, because this frequency distribution represents all the classes combined. This tells us that these words are probably the least important, as they are most likely words that are used across multiple classes, thereby providing our model with little actual signal as to what class they belong to. This tells us that we probably want to focus on words that appear heavily in articles from a given class, but rarely appear in articles from other classes. You may recall from previous lessons that this is exactly where **_TF-IDF Vectorization_** really shines!\n",

    "### Vectorizing with TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Although NLTK does provide functionality for vectorizing text documents with TF-IDF, we'll make use of scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorizer, because we already have experience with it, and because it's a bit easier to use, especially when the models we'll be feeding the vectorized data into are from scikit-learn, meaning that we don't have to worry about doing any extra processing to ensure they play nicely together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in order to use scikit-learn's `TfidfVectorizer()`, we need to pass in the data as raw text documents -- the `TfidfVectorizer()` handles the count vectorization process on it's own, and then fits and transforms the data into TF-IDF format. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` and instantiate `TfidfVectorizer()` \n",
    "* Call the vectorizer object's `.fit_transform()` method and pass in our `data` as input. Store the results in `tf_idf_data_train` \n",
    "* Also create a vectorized version of our testing data, which can be found in `newsgroups_test.data`. Store the results in `tf_idf_data_test`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** When transforming the test data, use the `.transform()` method, not the `.fit_transform()` method, as the vectorizer has already been fit to the training data. "
